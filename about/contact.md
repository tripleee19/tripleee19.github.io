## About Me
My name is Evan Edmunds and I am looking to start a career in the field of Data Science. I did my Undergrad in Biology with the intent of going into research. After college, I found a job working at Texas Childrens Hospital as a research assistant within the department of Congenital Heart Surgery. This is where I began to develop my interest in working with data and seeing the insights that could be gained under careful analysis. Wanting to devlop my skills, I pursued a Graduate degree that would give me the tools to investigate data effectively and generate actionable insights that can help make things better. To me, the field of Data Science is one that is based around continuous learning and problem solving; two things that made me want to pursue a career in data in the first place.
