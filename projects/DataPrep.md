## Overview
This project focused on three factors: the gathering, storing, and preliminary visualization of the data. The overarching goal of this project was to compare how review scores compared across various forms of media. The forms of media that were examined were books, movies, and video games. 
* Books had the most data by far, coming in at a total of 11,127 records. The data collection for books was the simplest, as the data was imported from a csv file obtained on Kaggle.
* For movies, html scraping was done by using the Beautiful Soup library in Python. 5 pages of html data were scraped from the website with 50 entries each, for a total of 250 records for movie data.
* Video game data was collected using an API to gather the data from rawg-video-games-database. 25 API calls were made to the website with 20 records in each call, for a total of 500 records.
