title: Visuals for Airline Safety
description: Are airlines safe?
---

## Overview
This project focused around a scenario of a recent airline crash that caused the public to doubt the safety of airlines. As a student, I was assigned the role of a data scientist that worked at an airline. My task was to collect data from various sources tod generate metrics and visuals that could be used to demonstrate the point that airlines are one of the safest forms of travel. The project was conducted in phases that viewed different perspectives of the process: a presentation made for internal review, an initial blogpost to establish a stance in the public eye, an infographic with easy to digest data points, and an official response to the public concerning recent events and airline safety.
