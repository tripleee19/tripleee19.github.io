title: Fraud Detection Outline
description: A framework for a project to take on with data science skills
---

## Overview
This project was the final project of the first course in the data science program at Bellevue University. As such, it is not a fully fleshed out project. Rather, it was a group project where members collaborated on creating the concept of a project that they would be able to take on in the future after learning the necessary skills throughout the course. It is also a showcase of presentation, research, and collaboration skills. The poster below is the final submission of the created project. The extended abstract goes into more depth about the process of the project from its inception to its completion, as well as the resources and data that would be used along the way.
