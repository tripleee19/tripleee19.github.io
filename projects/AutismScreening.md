title: Screening for Autism in Adults
description: Using machine learning methods to quickly predict if an individual is likely to have autism
---

## Overview
Autism  is most often diagnosed in toddlers and receiving a diagnosis as an adult can be a lengthy and difficult process. This difficulty can lead people with 
undiagnosed autism grow up without a proper support structure or helpful guidance. This project aimed to use machine learning methods to create a predictive model
to determine whether a person may have autism. Data containing demographic and survey information was cleaned, processed, and then used to create a random forest
classification model. The model performed highly against a number of different metrics and demonstrated effectiveness in predicting autism in an adult population.
